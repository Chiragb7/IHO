    <string name="right_knee">Evidence for bipedality: The knee is angled inward like in humans, rather than the more vertical position found in chimpanzees.This difference in orientation moves the support the lower legs offer directly under the body\'s center of gravity.</string>
    <string name="left_thigh">Human walk on two legs(bipedally) and have long legs and shor arms. Chimpanzees walk on all fours and have longer arms than legs.
