# Project Title

IHO App - Virtual Reality Enhancement

## Problem Statement

Develop Android and iOS augmented reality (AR) applications with a 3D model of the skeleton of Lucy and provide relevant information about the respective parts.

## Project Description

* The current IHO (Institute of Human Origins) app is available for download with the name “ASU Institute of Human Origins” on the Google Play Store & Apple Store.
* Our mission is to have a public outreach about human evolution and the conversion of the current 2D version of Lucy screen into a 3D can be the initial step of this growing application.
* Our AR applications (iOS & Android) provide an interactive interface to engage students and teachers, resulting in a better learning experience.

## Getting Started

The master branch contains the code for iOS and Android applications of the IHO App.

### Prerequisites

## Key Features of the Application

* A 3D-view of Lucy such that we can have a 360 degree view of the 3D model.
* A pop-up dialog box with relevant information regarding different Lucy parts when the respective button is tapped.
* Check the AR compatibility of the device the application is running on and inform the user accordingly.
